Andrew Weller's csci1300 final project.

A text based rpg in c++.

An extremely linear dungeon crawler. 
The game is a big game of mad-libs, the names of NPCs, enemies, foods, weapons are filled through random selection.
Otherwise the game is basically the same every time.

Take a spin and see if you can get to zone 10. Where nothing happens. I would consider that beating the game though.


//Post-description things.
My thoughts after this project:
This project I became overrun by the power of pointers.
Almost nothing in this project is return-by-value and is almost all by reference.
I did this without even considering the capacity for a memory leak.
I knew nothing about garbage collection and memory allocation, coming from a background in Java.

Still I did learn a lot about c++ and computers in general through this endeavour.
I'm going to improve more for the next project.
